# ECE252 Test Cases

This repo contains crowdsourced testcases for the ECE252 programming labs

## Usage

There isn't an elaborate script or anything right now to retrieve various test cases. In the meantime you can just use `wget` with the raw github file links.

```console
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ecesociety/ECE252-test-cases/master/LAB_NAME/COLLECTION/TEST_FILE.in
```

## Contributing

# ECE252 Test Cases

This repo contains crowdsourced testcases for the ECE252 programming labs

## Usage

There isn't an elaborate script or anything right now to retrieve various test cases. The best way to get all the test cases would be to clone the repository either on eceubuntu or on your local machine using:
`git clone https://github.com/ecesociety/ECE252-test-cases-S2019.git`

```console
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ecesociety/ECE252-test-cases/master/LAB_NAME/COLLECTION/TEST_FOLDER
```

## Contributing

Simply make a pull request with your test cases organized in a folder with a little README explaining what these test cases check for
